# Overview

This software allows the user to play the game Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock with the computer. 


I wrote this software to learn the differences in coding between Java and Kotlin. I found it very straight forward to use Kotlin having previously done a similar software in Java. I found that working with mutable and immutable variables was not too challenging. I also like that with Kotlin that you can have multiple classes in the same file where as with Java you can't.

The Stack Overflow link below helped me to be able to use Kotlin in VSCode instead of having to use Intellij

# Future Work

* There are some error messages that I didn't get figured out that I would like to fix.
* Do something more with the classes to make better use of the init function in the Character class.
* Make it into a mobile app.
